<!-- Write a program that allows the user to enter
     a number, print each number between one and the
      number the user entered, but for numbers that 
      divide by three without a remainder print Fizz
       instead. For numbers that divide by 5 without
        a remainder print Buzz and finally for numbers
         that divide by both three and five without a 
         remainder print FizzBuzz. -->
